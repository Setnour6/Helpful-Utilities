A computer program that checks a URL inputted by the user to see if it is credible under the general and C.R.A.A.P credibility rules.
This is mainly for windows operating system users (Windows 10, Windows 11, etc.)

Keep in mind the following credibility rules:
- no typos allowed
- domains must not end with ".com" (not checked by program)
- authors should be included (program checks metadata)
- article authors and/or publishers must not have a history of non-credible articles
- articles must not be more than 3650 days old.
- articles must not contain any bias, and should be clear to the audience.
- articles must follow the C.R.A.A.P test
