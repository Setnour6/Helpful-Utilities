This program is called the Date Time Difference Calculator.
It calculates the differences between user-inputted dates, times or both.
NOTICE: The program utilizes 24-hour time. For example, 14:30:30 is 2:30:30 PM.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.10 or higher is preferred)
- opening a command prompt terminal of your choice and typing `pip install datetime` but only if the program doesn't run.

make sure you have a good understanding on how command line interfaces (CLIs) work, how to use Python in a basic manner, and how to open a .py file.
