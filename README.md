# The Helpful Utilities Collection
A collection of simple programs that assists with everyone's computer needs.
Feel free to suggest more program ideas.

The programs are coded using Python, designed to be as basic and simple as possible.
Each program has its own README.md file so you can see the instructions for each program.

The best part is that you don't need any internet connection to use them (unless explicitly stated in their README.md file).
Simply download the contents of this repository as a ZIP file (or go to the releases section and click on the programs you want), unzip the programs, and enjoy.

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system (version 3.10 or higher is preferred).
- A good understanding of Python.
- A good understanding of the command prompt terminal and/or any other Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Notice

This is done mainly as a hobby project.
