This program is called the Installed Apps Printer.
It scans for and displays all installed apps and programs on the computer. Unlike the programs list on the control panel and settings, ALL of the programs are shown.

NOTICE: The program is case-sensitive.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.10 or higher is preferred)
- opening a command prompt terminal of your choice and typing `pip install time` and/or `pip install sys` but only if the program doesn't run.

make sure you have a good understanding on how command line interfaces (CLIs) work, how to use Python in a basic manner, and how to open a .py file.
