This program is called the Directory Storage Sizes Printer.
It scans the files in the directory and most of, if not all, the subdirectories and then prints the sizes of the directories that takes up the storage space on your computer.
NOTICE: The program is case-sensitive.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.10 or higher is preferred)
- opening a command prompt terminal of your choice and typing `pip install time` and/or `pip install sys` but only if the program doesn't run.

make sure you have a good understanding on how command line interfaces (CLIs) work, how to use Python in a basic manner, and how to open a .py file.
